# Use github to sync vi config
*Tested on Ubuntu14.04 and 16.04

## How to use
[git](https://git-scm.com/)* and [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim)* must be installed
```
git clone https://github.com/howhow/vimrc ~/.my_config/vim
cd ~/.my_config/vim
./install.sh cmake ctags cscope python2.7 silversearcher-ag
```
**NOTE**: On older systems (e.g. Ubuntu 14.04) you may run into compilation
issues with `cmake`. Therefore, install the following instead:
```
./install.sh cmake3 ctags cscope python2.7 silversearcher-ag
```

- you could clone to anywhere, but I like to save all my configs into one place
